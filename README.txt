README

In the repository you will find a folder named "data" with all the databases needed for all the necessary executions. 

The files are named with a number and the title, so they will be executed in the order that the numbers imply, first the file 1-..., then the file 2-... and so on. 

The first two files provide the code necessary to obtain the databases with which we will finally work, so it is essential to execute files number 1 and 2. 

Except for files 1 and 2, the rest are unfinished so you will find comments on things to change, modify, delete, etc.
